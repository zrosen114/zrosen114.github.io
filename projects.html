<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>I have worked on a few projects while attending OU, but there are two projects I am most proud of. The first project is this website that I created for my MIS 3033 (Business Programming Language) class. The other project I am proud of is a project I worked on for MIS 3353 (Business Databases). This project required my team to create a database for a company. We read a case study of what the company wanted, and we went through each step of creating a database. We started with an ERD, then created our SQL queries, and finally implimented everything into a database server.</h2>
