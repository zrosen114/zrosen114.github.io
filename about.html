<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>I was born in Chicago, IL and when I was young my family moved to Las Vegas. In Las Vegas my family ran a business, but then we moved to San Antonio when I was 10 years old. I went to Ronald Reagan Highschool and then decided I wanted to study at the OU. I love everything about OU and I have made some great experiences here in Norman. In my free time I am an avid paintball player which takes up most of my weekends. I also work during the week to pay for my paintball habit as well as paying for my education.</h2>
